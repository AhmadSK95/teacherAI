- Integration APIs for Google Workspace, LMS providers, roster providers, and identity context.
- Public datasets for district intelligence and reporting alignment.
- Content licensing references for OER and curriculum reuse boundaries.
- Procurement reference for district privacy agreements.

## High-Priority Source Groups
- Compliance baseline: FERPA, COPPA, IDEA, Section 504, DOE guidance.

## Next Actions Suggested
1. Confirm WIDA licensing scope for product use.
2. Stand up Google plus Clever sandbox integration for pilot flows.
3. Encode content license policy checks before ingestion at scale.
4. Align district legal packet to NDPA template before pilots.
